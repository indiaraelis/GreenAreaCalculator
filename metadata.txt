qgisMinimumVersion=3.16
description=Calculates green vegetation areas per census sector using NDVI analysis and spatial statistics. This plugin analyzes multispectral imagery to determine vegetation coverage within demographic boundaries, providing statistical analysis and visualization tools for urban planning and environmental assessment.

Requirements:
- Multispectral raster data with red and near-infrared bands
- Census sector polygon data
- Consistent coordinate reference system between all layers

The plugin works on all supported platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and uses only standard QGIS libraries without external dependencies.

about=Green Area Calculator is a QGIS plugin designed for urban planners, environmental researchers, and GIS professionals who need to analyze vegetation coverage within specific demographic areas. 

The plugin performs NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) calculations on multispectral imagery and intersects the results with census sector boundaries to provide detailed statistics about green area coverage per sector.

Key Features:
• NDVI-based vegetation analysis
• Automated calculation per census sector
• Statistical reporting and visualization
• Support for multiple raster and vector formats
• Cross-platform compatibility
• Intuitive user interface

The plugin requires multispectral raster data containing at least red and near-infrared bands, along with polygon data representing census sectors or other administrative boundaries. All data should be in the same coordinate reference system for accurate analysis.

This tool is particularly useful for:
- Urban green space assessment
- Environmental impact studies
- Land use planning
- Academic research in urban ecology
- Government reporting on green infrastructure

changelog=Version 1.0.0 (2025-01-XX):
- Initial release
- Basic NDVI calculation functionality
- Census sector statistics integration
- User-friendly dialog interface
- Multi-format data support
- Cross-platform compatibility
